# How to get the device id
# Identify your mouse via 'lsusb'
#   Bus 003 Device 004: ID 1038:1729 SteelSeries ApS
# So your mouse is on Bus 3 and has the id 4

# Now dive in deeper with 'lsusb -t' and check out "Bus 3" in detail
#/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ehci-pci/2p, 480M
#    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/8p, 480M
#        |__ Port 1: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
#        |__ Port 1: Dev 3, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 1.5M
#        |__ Port 2: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M
#        |__ Port 2: Dev 4, If 1, Class=Human Interface Device, Driver=usbhid, 12M

# The node with 'Dev 4' tells you, your mouse is on Bus 3, Port 1, Port 2

# Now do a sanity check with 'ls /sys/bus/usb/devices'

# -> Select the matching sub-device. This really much depends on your mouse. It can be the "1.0". For my SteelSeries mice, it was always "1.1". So here it is 3-1.2:1.1 (Bus3-Port1.Port2:SubDevice)
